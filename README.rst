Discurses
=========

|PyPI version|

A CLI for discord, written in Python. The name is a combination of
discord and curses, as in the terminal interface library. Discurses
doesn’t use curses, but i originally planned to. It is now built using
urwid, a widget library which *can* use curses as a rendering engine,
but discurses works fine without it.

Questions, bug reports, PRs and comments are all very welcome.

Installation
------------

Linux
~~~~~

That one is pretty easy:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install discurses

Python 3.6 is required (as discord.py does not yet work with 3.7).

If you're having trouble launching the application post-install, check
your PATH variable.

.. code:: shell

    $ echo $PATH

Pip installs by default into $HOME/.local/bin which is not typically
part of your path. You can add it with the following command:

.. code:: shell

    $ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin

Note: this is a temporary fix, you would need to add $HOME/.local/bin to
your .profile or .bashrc to make it permanent, check your distributions
documentation for PATH settings.


Windows
~~~~~~~

Start out by following
`this <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide>`__
guide.

After that, follow the instructions for linux above

Seriously: urwid is *sadly* not supported on Windows, and since
discurses is built on top of that, such an OS is not supported. You may
use the official desktop client anyway.

Authentication
--------------

Put the file ``example_discurses.yaml`` in your ``~/.config/``
directory, replace the placeholder with your discord token and rename
the file to ``discurses.yaml``. You can get the token by visiting
https://discordapp.com/channels/@me, opening the developer tools
(Ctrl+shift+i or Command+shift+i) and click on the ``Application`` tab,
then on the sidebar: ``Local Storage`` then click the URL from the
dropdown and you should see the ``token`` key followed by your token,
copy what's inside the speech marks and put it in your ``.yaml`` file.
This may not be easy using the Discord webapp as there is a mechanism
in place to delete the token from storage once the page is loaded (occurs
when the splash screen disappears).
